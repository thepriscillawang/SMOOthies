text = "Welcome and aloha! You – Hawaii’s rising entrepreneurial star – have just opened a street stand to sell the world’s best tropical smoothie, bar none! 

Your SMOOthies Stand is located on the edge of famous Waikiki Beach and in the heart of one of the state’s most popular tourist destinations.

As the stand’s owner and manager, your mission is to sell as many delicious fruit smoothies to the tourists, residents, and patrons of Waikiki as you possibly can, every day for two weeks, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

If you raise $500 or more over the two-week period, you can open up a storefront on 
Kalakaua Avenue and you’ll be on your way to building a solid business. However, if you fail to raise at least $500, you will go bankrupt. [insert sad emoji]

You’ll begin with $100 in cash. To keep your smoothie stand operating, you will need to buy sufficient tropical ingredients and supplies: pineapple, mango, and dragon fruit, along with ice, milk, and cup sets (cups, lids, and straws). Finding and creating the perfect recipe proportions will be critical to your success!
 
To make enough money, you will need to set a sales price that produces enough revenue to buy what you need each day and still turn a profit. But be careful – overpricing your product can cause sales to drop.
 
If sales do fall, you can hold a two-for-one sale, stay open longer, or put up balloons. Also, be sure to listen to your customers’ comments and keep or change the smoothie recipe in response to their likes and dislikes.
 
Some days will be great – there are parades and sports events that will increase sales; but stay alert - your ingredients may spoil and those Waikiki birds can fly off with your fruit!
 
Good luck and we hope to see you with your own Kalakaua Avenue storefront very soon!
